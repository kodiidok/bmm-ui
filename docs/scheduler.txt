*version 1*

create a table with 3 rows and n columns.

- top row for header: days (mon 07, tue 08, wed 09 ...)
- 2nd row: morning
- 3rd row: evening

- n cols should be decided by a date range
- for this, use 2 date inputs: for date-start and date-end
- each date input should have a mini calendar where the user can select the date
- use these 2 dates to calculate the n, and render n coloumns for the table. 
- whenever n chages, the ncols of table should update: can use something like this *useEffect(()=>{}, [n]);*

- each cell in the table should be clickable: have a button in each cell and make it invisible using css.
- this way, we can add an event handler to the cells, to show a popup with the details of the cell.

a cell must show a list of events. 

so, overall we need to have the following components:
- Scheduler
- SchedulerCell
- DateRangeSelector
- SchedulerCellEvents
